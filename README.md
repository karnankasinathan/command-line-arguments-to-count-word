# command-line-arguments-to-count-word
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
mport the sys module.

### Step 2:
Pass the filename as the first argument after the name of script. Open the file as sys.argv[1]

### Step 3:
Read the file using read() method.

### Step 4: 
Use split() method to split the file content into words.

### Step 5: 
Use len() to find the total words.

### Step 6: 
Run the program to determine the number of words in the file created.

PROGRAM:
```
#program is developed: KARNAN K
# REF.NO: 22003223
import sys
count= 0
with open(sys.argv[1],'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        word= line.split()
        count += len(word)
print("program is developed: SATHISH.R")
print("word count in file = ",count)
```
### OUTPUT:



## RESULT:
Thus the program is written to find the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
